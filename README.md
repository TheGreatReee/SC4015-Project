# SC4015 Cyber Physical Security Project - Correlation Power Analysis
This repository is submitted as part of the NTU CCDS course, SC4015 CPS module. This was a group project done by Kopikia, @TheGreatReee, and WeiCocoGoat.

## Project Description
Given a set of power traces (waveform.csv), implement Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) to extract the key. 

## Contents
- CPA_Project_key_extraction.ipynb - Python Script for processing the power traces and running the Correlation Power Analysis attack. Extracts the full 16 byte key. 
- waveform.csv - A set of 110 power traces
- CPA_Projecto.ipynb - A cut down version of CPA_Project_key_extraction.ipynb, extracting only the first byte of the key
